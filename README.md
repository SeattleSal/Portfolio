# Portfolio
This page is an online portofolio to show off projects created. Currently it has many placeholders for the student to replace with published products (websites made with html, css and javascript). This will be available to potential employers to showcase the student's knowledge and ability.

## Page layout and media queries
The layout has been setup using flexbox to format on a regular screen but also be reactive for smaller screens and resizing of the web browser.

## Use of CSS Variables
Variables were used for the color scheme to keep the color palette consistent as well as easy to reference through out the css.
